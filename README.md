# WebServices

<b>iOS Project</b> to show how to interact with REST and SOAP Web Services.
<br>
The product is an app for searching and buying books. It interacts with four different Web Services:
- eBay API (book offer search)
- GoodReads API (book search)
- Simple Bank REST (own implementation)
- Simple Bank SOAP (own implementation)


The simple REST and SOAP Web Services simulate a bank service charging a credit card.

- Used Bottle framework (Python) for REST WS
- Used Java for SOAP WS

<b>Note:</b> The complexity in the Bank (REST and SOAP) web services is minimum. The real value is how to interact and generate requests in iOS with Swift.
